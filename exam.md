# About the Exam
	
v1.1.0-20250923

The exam includes two parts: a (1) practical part and (2) an oral discussion. 

### Practical Part

The practical part can be done in two alternative ways:

- Developing the assignments proposed during the course. 
  - The assignments are small projects about a part of the course. 
  - There will be 4 assignments, corresponding to the main parts of the course
  - Assignments are meant to be done during the course (but there are no deadlines for delivering them) 
  - Assignments are **not** partial exams, there is not a single evaluation for each one. They constitute the material used to structure the oral discussion.

- Doing a single a project. For the project, there are two further options:
  - The first option is a project proposed by students
    - the project idea should be first proposed and discussed with the your professor(s) – either by emails or during office hours
    - the idea must be effective for applying in practice relevant concepts, techniques and technologies that concernn Software Architecture and Platforms and that have been discussed during the course 
  - The second option is choosing a *project work*, from a list
    - Project works concern real-world problems and projects proposed by companies and software houses from D.I.R. (*Distretto dell'Informatica Romagnolo*), in cooperation with the course 
    - Such real-world projects are suitably scaled and packaged in order to be good as a project work for an exam
  - The deliverable of the project consist in a repo including the documentation of the project and the source code of a prototype implementing essential features the documentation should concern all aspects – from analysis to deployment – related to the project, properly organized and described using the methods and tools discussed during the course.

  - The project deliverable can be submitted on the course web site.

- The practical part can be done either individually or in groups (max 3 persons – exceptions should be discussed).

### Oral discussion

The oral discussion is about both the practical part and, more generally, the key concepts and methods discussed during the course. The discussion is **individual**.

- The discussion about the single project includes 2 main parts:
  - a first part – about 20 mins – involving a presentation of the project, using slides or whatever tool. The presentation should be effective in reporting:
    - the idea/motivation
    - the analysis, the design and development 
    - a demo of the implemented prototype
    - a discussion about the validation 
  - a second part - discussion, based questions and answers, connections with course topics
